The Unofficial CK2 Patch (aka UCK2P), is a bugfixing and content mod for Crusader Kings II that aims to improve ck2 while being as close to the base game as possible.


#Patch Notes
V0.1 AKA Roman update
-added Colosseum of Rome from wtwsms
The reason for this is if you wish to play as Rome and want your capital to not be catholic.
-You can no longer give the pope Rome if you are catholic and the Roman or the Byzantine Empires.
-The Roman Empire, Latin Empire and the Italian Empire can all use the Imperial Diadem
-Any christian can use the Reichskrone.
