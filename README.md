#Patch Notes
V0.1 AKA Roman update
 -added Colosseum of Rome from wtwsms
    The reason for this is if you wish to play as Rome and want your capital to not be catholic 
 -can no longer give the pope Rome if you are Roman or the Byzantine Empires
 -HRE, Italia and the Latin Empire can now restore Rome as well.
 -The Roman Empire, Latin Empire and the Italian Empire can all use the Imperial Diadem
 -Any christian can use the Reichskrone.
