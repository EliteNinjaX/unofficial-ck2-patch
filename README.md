#Patch Notes
V0.1 AKA Roman update
 -added Colosseum of Rome from wtwsms
    The reason for this is if you wish to play as Rome and want your capital to not be catholic
 -Rome was "owned" by the Romans emperors and not the pope until 325
 -can no longer give the pope Rome if you are Roman or the Byzantine Empires
 -The Roman Empire, Latin Empire and the Italian Empire can all use the Imperial Diadem
 -Any christian can use the Reichskrone.
